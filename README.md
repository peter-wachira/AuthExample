## Architecture

The App is not organized into multiple modules but follows the same principles of
the Presentation, Domain, and Data Layers.
The presentation layer handles the UI work with the logic contained in the **ViewModel**.
The UI uses a **LiveData** object from the ViewModel and observes it using the **Observer Pattern**.
**retrofit** and **coroutines** to handle background work asynchronously. Additionally, note that
the ViewModel uses the **viewModelScope** to launch the coroutines while Fragments use the **viewLifeCycleOwner**
to observe data.


## Libraries

This app takes use of the following libraries:

- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)ðŸš€
